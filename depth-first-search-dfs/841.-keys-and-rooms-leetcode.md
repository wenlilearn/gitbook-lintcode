#### 841. keys and rooms

There are `N` rooms and you start in room `0`.  Each room has a distinct number in `0, 1, 2, ..., N-1`, and each room may have some keys to access the next room. 

Formally, each room `i` has a list of keys `rooms[i]`, and each key `rooms[i][j]` is an integer in `[0, 1, ..., N-1]` where `N = rooms.length`.  A key `rooms[i][j] = v` opens the room with number `v`.

Initially, all the rooms start locked \(except for room `0`\). 

You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return `true` if and only if you can enter every room.

1. 
**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:  
We start in room 0, and pick up key 1.
We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.
We then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.
We then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can't enter the room with number 2.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= rooms.length <= 1000`
2. `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
3. The number of keys in all rooms combined is at most `3000`.

{% tab title="Solution" %}
#### BFS

* 实际上这个问题是问从一个点出发能不能遍历到图上的所有的点
* 直接用BFS遍历即可, 然后把所有的visited的点都存下来
* 最后看visited这个集合的长度能不能满足房间的个数

      }
      
      return visited.size() == rooms.size();
