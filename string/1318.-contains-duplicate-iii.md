# 1318. Contains Duplicate III

### Problem

Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices `i`and `j` in the array such that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is at most `t` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`.

#### Example

Given nums = `[1,3,1]`, k = `1`, t = `1`, return `false`.

### Solution

**Bucket**

* Given the gap between the numbers must be less or equal than t, we can consider t + 1 as the bucket size\(must include t\)
* In order to handle negative numbers, we shift all numbers from Integer.MIN\_VALUE to 0, that means every number should be - Integer.MIN\_VALUE
* Thus for any given number\(after the \`-Integer.MIN\_VALUE\` remap\), should be landing in one of the buckets denoted as i / \(t + 1\)
* There're 3 possible ways that we encountered another number with less or equal t distance within k steps:
  *  The new number lands in the same bucket
  * The new number has less than t distance with its previous remapped
  * The new number has less than t distance with its next remapped
* Thus we just need to calculate the distance between them
* Also, we're sliding a k size window, if more than k, we need to evict i - k number\(mapped\)

```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param nums: the given array
     * @param k: the given k
     * @param t: the given t
     * @return: whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

          long bucket = (long)((double)remapped / (t + 1));

          buckets.put(bucket, remapped);
        }
        
        return false;
